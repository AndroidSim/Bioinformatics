### Sequence Analysis
In the directory, Sequence-2-Sequence, is a program written to do alignments between two or more sequences by dynamic programming.
### Structure Analysis
In the directory, Sequence-2-Structure, is a program written to do a single alignment between a protein sequence and a protein structure by dynamic programming. This process is called "threading".

## Threading: protein structure prediction from sequence
[LOOPP Project](http://cbsu.tc.cornell.edu/software/loopp/loopp_doc.html)

Because it was long ago, I do not remember much of my involvment with this project. From some of the Perl scripts that I wrote, it has something to do with optimizing certain parameters for aligning two protein structures. I would have to review these files again to get a better understanding.

The Perl scripts in following directories in the main LOOPP directory are my contributions:

ktd0_opt

x2xoptpmtest

Some results of this optimization procedure are in the log files in the following directory:

x2xvss2s
